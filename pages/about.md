If you'd like to copy an Oral History as Data template and get started, go to this site's repo--[the OHD GitHub Template repository](https://github.com/oralhistoryasdata/template){:target="_blank"}--and click the green "Use This Template" button at the right.

## About Oral History as Data

The [Oral History as Data (OHD)](https://github.com/oralhistoryasdata/) framework is a static website generator that allows users to analyze and publish coded oral history or qualitative interview files. By turning transcriptions into tagged/coded CSV files, adding a list of filters, and creating a simple markdown file for each interview (to be included in the _transcripts collection), OHD will provide filterable transcripts and a color coded visualization for all transcripts included. 


## Documentation

- **[Full OHD Documentation](https://oralhistoryasdata.github.io/docs/) -** Our documentation provides how to guides, tutorials, and stepped instruction for building your own Oral History as Data project.  

- **[CollectionBuilder Documentation](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/docs/) -** OHD is built on top of a CollectionBuilder-CSV template, so any options used in CSV can be used here.
